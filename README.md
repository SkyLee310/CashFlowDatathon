Cash Flow Intelligence is a predictive analytics engine developed by Team 404error for the AstraZeneca Datathon, designed to transform fragmented financial data into high-fidelity liquidity foresight. Addressing the challenge of blind spots in regional cash visibility, our solution leverages a recursive machine learning model (CatBoost) to generate 6-month rolling forecasts with over 90% accuracy, while simultaneously deploying an automated "Operational Risk Radar" to isolate high-impact anomalies. By integrating forensic integrity checks based on Benford's Law and a dynamic dashboard for real-time monitoring, this system empowers finance teams to proactively identify structural dips and liquidity shocks, effectively bridging the gap between raw ERP logs and strategic decision-making.
